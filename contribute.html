        <p class="question">How to make a template</p>
        <p class="answer">First, create the template. It should be a small portion of a skin, like eyes or hair. Here's some examples:</p>
        <br>
        <div style="display: block;">
            <img class="pixelart examples" src="assets/eye0.png"><br><img class="pixelart examples" src="assets/hair0.png">
        </div>
        <p>Make sure the templates are grayscale. Lighter shades work better than darker shades.</p>
        <p>These examples don't have shading, but you can implement shading if you like.</p>
        <p>I will try to figure out what needs to be tinted and what doesn't (in the case of things like eyes), so all you need to worry about is making the template.</p>
        <p>Once you've finished the template, send it to me however you like (on a minecraft skin website, mediafire, github, whatever works for you). I will then try and implement it, and give you credit on the generator page.</p>
